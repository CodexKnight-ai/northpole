            Ideally any investment (whether lumpsum or SIP) should be done keeping in mind various things like current income, risk profile, age, tax constraints, liquidity needs, time frame and certain other unique constraints. Lumpsum investment is preferred when one has large amount of surplus funds and more importantly if he/she thinks that market has majorly corrected or it won’t fall just after making the investment. Lumpsum investment done over a longer period helps generate compounding rate of returns.

            What’s the difference between Lumpsum and SIP?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl font-normal leading-7 md:leading-8 text-[#bfbfbf]">
            In lumpsum investment one needs to invest only once whereas, in SIP or Systematic Investment Plan one invests a fixed amount periodically. In lumpsum investment style the market condition plays a huge role because if the market makes a major correction after your investment, then it might take few years to reach your original investment amount. Whereas, in SIP or systematic investment style one need not worry about timing the market as investment is made during both ups and downs of the market. Therefore, the return generated is weighted average return.
